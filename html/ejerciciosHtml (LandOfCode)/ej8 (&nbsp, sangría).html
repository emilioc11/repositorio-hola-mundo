            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I realized recently that what one thinks about in the shower in the morning is more important than I'd thought. 
            I knew it was a good time to have ideas. 
            Now I'd go further: now I'd say it's hard to do a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone who's worked on difficult problems is probably familiar 
            with the phenomenon of working hard to figure something out, failing, and then suddenly 
            seeing the answer a bit later while doing something else. There's a kind of thinking you do without trying to. 
            I'm increasingly convinced this type of thinking is not merely helpful in solving hard problems, but necessary. 
            The tricky part is, you can only control it indirectly.
